# Anova-testing

In this project I  used crop data to check the significance of various variables on the final yield of crops .

I used a 7 step procedure:

Step 1: Loading the data into R

Step 2: Performing the ANOVA test

Step 3: Finding the best-fit model

Step 4: Check for homoscedasticity

Step 5: Doing a post-hoc test

Step 6: Plotting the results in a graph

Step 7: Reporting the results
